Carry it on, carry it on  
Carry it on. Oh, carry it on.

There's a task that lies before us  
We are strong when we're together  
There's a word that's needing saying  
Carry it on, carry it on

Look with pride in where we've come from  
And with hope in where we're going  
Ev'ry vict'ry brings another  
Carry it on, carry it on

All our mothers sang before  us  
All our children sing the chorus  
Come on sisters, lift your voices  
Carry it on, carry it on

Look with pride in where we've come from  
And with hope in where we're going  
Ev'ry vict'ry brings another,  
Carry it on, carry it on

All our mothers sang before us  
All our children sing the chorus  
Come on people, lift your voices,  
Carry it on, carry it on

Carry it on, carry it on...

Come on people, lift your voices
Carry it on, carry it on!
