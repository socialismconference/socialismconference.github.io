## Beasts of England

> George Orwell describes the tune to this song from "Animal Farm" as being something between "La Cucaracha" and "Darling Clementine"

Beasts of England! Beasts of Ireland!  
Beasts of land and sea and skies!  
Hear the hoofbeats of tomorrow!  
See the golden future rise!

How does the life of an animal pass?  
In endless drudgery.  
What's the first lesson an animal learns?  
To endure its slavery.  
How does the life of an animal end?  
In cruel butchery.

Beasts of England! Beasts of Ireland!  
Beasts of land and sea and skies!  
Hear the hoofbeats of tomorrow!  
See the golden future rise!

Now the day of beasts is coming,  
Tyrant man shall lose his throne  
And the shining fields of England  
Shall be trod by beasts alone.

Pull the rings from out your noses  
Tear the saddle from your back!  
Bit and spur must rust forever,  
Cruel whips no more shall crack.

Beasts of England, seize the prizes,  
Wheat and barley, oats and hay,  
Clover, beans and mangel wurzel  
Shall be ours upon that day.
