## Beasts of England

> George Orwell describes the tune to this song from "Animal Farm" as being something between "La Cucaracha" and "Darling Clementine"

Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland  
Beasts of every land and clime  
Hearken to my joyful tidings  
Of the golden future time

Soon or late the day is coming  
Tyrant Man shall be o'erthrown  
And the fruitful fields of England  
Shall be trod by beasts alone

Rings shall vanish from our noses  
And the harness from our back  
Bit and spur shall rust forever  
Cruel whips no more shall crack  
Riches more than mind can picture  
Wheat and barley, oats and hay  
Clover, beans, and mangel-wurzels  
Shall be ours upon that day

Bright will shine the fields of England  
Purer shall its waters be  
Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes  
On the day that sets us free

For that day we all must labour  
Though we die before it break  
Cows and horses, geese and turkeys  
All must toil for freedom's sake

Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland  
Beasts of every land and clime  
Hearken well and spread my tidings  
Of the golden future time
