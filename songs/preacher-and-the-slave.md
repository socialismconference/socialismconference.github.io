## The Preacher and the Slave

> by Joe Hill

### Verse #1:

Long-haired preachers come out every night  
Try to tell you what's wrong and what's right  
But when asked how â€™bout something to eat  
They will answer in voices so sweet

### Chorus Type #1:

You will eat, bye and bye  
In that glorious land above the sky (Way up high!)  
Work and pray, live on hay  
You'll get pie in the sky when you die (That's a lie!)

### Verse #2:

And the Starvation Army, they play  
And they sing and they clap and they pray  
Till they get all your coin on the drum  
Then they tell you when you're on the bum

> Chorus Type #1

### Verse #3:

Holy Rollers and Jumpers come out  
And they holler, they jump and they shout  
Give your money to Jesus, they say  
He will cure all diseases today

> Chorus Type #1

### Verse #4:

If you fight hard for children and wife  
Try to get something good in this life  
You're a sinner and bad man, they tell  
When you die you will sure go to hell.

> Chorus Type #1

### Verse #5:

Workingmen of all countries, unite  
Side by side we for freedom will fight  
When the world and its wealth we have gained  
To the grafters we'll sing this refrain

### Chorus Type #2: 

You will eat, bye and bye  
When you've learned how to cook and how to fry  
Chop some wood, 'twill do you good  
Then you'll eat in the sweet bye and bye 

> The chorus is sung in a call and response pattern.

> You will eat [You will eat] bye and bye [bye and bye]  
In that glorious land above the sky [Way up high]  
Work and pray [Work and pray] live on hay [live on hay]    
You'll get pie in the sky when you die [That's a lie!]

>Thus the final verse becomes:

> You will eat [You will eat] bye and bye [bye and bye]  
When you've learned how to cook and how to fry [and bake a pie!]  
Chop some wood [Chop some wood], 'twill do you good [do you good]  
Then you'll eat in the sweet bye and bye [That's no lie]
