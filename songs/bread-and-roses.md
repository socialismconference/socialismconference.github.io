## Bread and Roses

As we go marching, marching, in the beauty of the day  
A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray  
Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses  
For the people hear us singing, bread and roses, bread and roses.

As we come marching, marching, we battle too, for men,  
For they are in the struggle and together we shall win.  
Our days shall not be sweated from birth until life closes,  
Hearts starve as well as bodies, give us bread, but give us roses.

As we come marching, marching, un-numbered women dead  
Go crying through our singing their ancient call for bread,  
Small art and love and beauty their trudging spirits knew  
Yes, it is bread we fight for, but we fight for roses, too.

As we go marching, marching, we sound the greater call.  
For the rising of the women means the rising of us all.  
No more the drudge and idler, ten that toil where one reposes,  
But a sharing of life's glories, bread and roses, bread and roses.
